# What's new in Microsoft Purview | Microsoft Learn

Whether it's adding new solutions, updating existing features based on your feedback, or rolling out fresh and updated documentation, [Microsoft Purview](purview) helps you stay on top of the ever-changing [data governance](unified-catalog), [data security](purview-security), and [risk and compliance](purview-compliance) areas. Take a look at the following information to see what's new in Microsoft Purview.

## What's planned for Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview continues to add new solutions and features to help with data governance, data security, and risk and compliance in your organization. Check out the following roadmap sites to learn more about what's planned for Microsoft Purview:

- [Roadmap](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2339022) for data governance solutions.
- [Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?msockid=305e5dff038362fc15a64e2f02396376&amp;filters=&amp;searchterms=Microsoft%2CPurview) for data security and risk and compliance solutions.

## September 2026

### Data Loss Prevention

- **General availability**: Integrate Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access with Purview to protect text, files, and AI interactions at the network layer, enforce restrictive actions based on DLP policies, and detect risky user activity through Insider Risk Management. It helps prevent sensitive data from being shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, apps, APIs, and add-ins, including generative AI platforms, social media, and collaborative platforms. See [Learn about Microsoft Purview Network Data Security](dlp-network-data-security-learn).

### Information Barriers

- **New**: [Create an Information Barriers policy compliance report](information-barriers-sharepoint-report) to identify SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, and user-owned SharePoint Embedded containers that no longer comply after Information Barriers policy changes.

## August 2026

### Data Governance

- **Updated**: [Data Quality capability](unified-catalog-data-quality) requires the Microsoft Purview account and its data sources to be in the same Azure region.

### Data Loss Prevention

- **In preview**: [Use data loss prevention policies for non-Microsoft connected apps](dlp-non-microsoft-connected-applications). Create DLP policies that protect sensitive data at rest in non-Microsoft connected applications, such as Box and Google Workspace. These policies use the existing Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps connectors and support the same classification engine available for Microsoft 365 locations.
- **Updated**: The [Endpoint DLP capability comparison](endpoint-dlp-learn-about) now clarifies that policies for access by apps not included in a restricted apps list or restricted app group are supported on Windows but not on macOS.
- **Updated**: If an Exchange DLP policy uses sensitivity labels as a condition and policy tips while mandatory labeling is enabled, selecting a label from the mandatory-labeling prompt [doesn't reevaluate the policy tip](dlp-sensitivity-label-as-condition). The configured DLP action is still enforced.
- **Updated**: In cross-tenant Microsoft Teams chats and channels, [DLP policy enforcement follows the tenant that initiated the conversation](dlp-microsoft-teams). A user's home-tenant DLP policies don't automatically apply when another tenant hosts the chat or thread.
- **In preview**: Prepare Endpoint DLP for [permission changes in macOS 27](endpoint-dlp-macos-27-changes). Deploy client version 101.26072 or later, configure protection modes, monitor permission status, and notify users if they disable the required **Device Control and Data Access** permission.
- **Updated**: Guidance for [DLP policies in Microsoft Edge for Business](dlp-browser-dlp-learn) now explains policy sync status, where to investigate managed and unmanaged app activity, and coverage limitations caused by duplicate app catalog entries, encoded traffic, dynamic endpoints, and shared consumer and enterprise URLs.

### Data lifecycle management

- **Updated**: When you remove the last hold from an inactive mailbox, Microsoft 365 automatically applies a 30-day delay hold. Learn how to [identify and remove delay holds](delete-an-inactive-mailbox#remove-a-delay-hold-from-an-inactive-mailbox) before recalculating mailbox hold status.
- **New**: [Remove a retention hold from an unlicensed OneDrive site](remove-retention-hold-unlicensed-onedrive-site) by using Security & Compliance PowerShell. The guidance covers tenant-level and site-level holds, prerequisites, and common errors that can block site deletion.
- **In preview**: [Permanently delete SharePoint and OneDrive files with Priority Cleanup](priority-cleanup-permanent-deletion). After simulation, review, and required approvals, selected files bypass the recycle bins and are no longer discoverable in SharePoint search, Microsoft 365 Copilot, or eDiscovery.

### Data Security Posture Management

- **Updated**: [Microsoft Purview support for Anthropic Claude Enterprise](ai-claude-enterprise) now includes data classification, Insider Risk Management, Communication Compliance, eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management, and Compliance Manager.

### eDiscovery

- **Updated**: App-only authentication for eDiscovery cmdlets in Security & Compliance PowerShell is unsupported. Transition automations to Microsoft Graph APIs where available; the [documented certificate-based authentication steps](edisc-permissions#configure-app-only-authentication-for-ediscovery-powershell) are best-effort guidance for existing automations and don't change the support status.

### Sensitivity labels

- **New**: Before enforcing an auto-labeling policy, run it in [simulation mode](auto-label-simulation-results) to identify which items it would label without making any changes. Review the match results and source distribution to determine whether the policy is ready to enforce.
- **New**: [The **Insights** tab](auto-label-insights-tab) in the policy details panel provides an at-a-glance view of an auto-labeling policy's performance. The information shown varies depending on whether the policy is running in simulation or enforcement mode, helping you understand how it identifies or labels content.
- **In preview**: [Sensitivity label policies for non-Microsoft connected apps](information-protection-non-microsoft-connected-apps). Create auto-labeling policies that protect sensitive data at rest in non-Microsoft connected apps, including Box and Google Workspace. These policies use the existing Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps connectors and support the same classification engine available for Microsoft 365 locations.
- **Updated**: Added guidance describing how to provide external users access to open files protected by user-defined permissions sensitivity labels. For more information, see [Limitations](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files#limitations).
- **Updated**: Auto-labeling policies can target more than 100 SharePoint sites by using an [existing adaptive scope with the SharePointAdaptiveScopes parameter with New-AutoSensitivityLabelPolicy](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically#use-powershell-for-auto-labeling-policies).
- **New**: Review the [minimum OneNote versions and supported sensitivity label capabilities](sensitivity-labels-versions#sensitivity-label-capabilities-in-onenote) for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and the web.
- **Updated**: If an active auto-labeling policy stops matching Exchange email because a rule failed to load, [contact Microsoft Support to identify the affected rule](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically#policy-rule-fails-to-load).

### Shared capabilities

- **New**: [Run on-demand classification scans on Windows endpoints](on-demand-classification-endpoints) to discover sensitive information without waiting for files to be opened or modified. The new guidance covers [billing and best practices](endpoints-best-practices), [monitoring and troubleshooting](endpoints-monitor-troubleshoot), and [frequently asked questions](endpoints-faq-reference).
- **New**: Microsoft 365 audit log activities now include [Microsoft Defender for Cloud activities](audit-log-activities#microsoft-defender-for-cloud-activities), [People Skills activities](audit-log-activities#people-skills-activities), [Microsoft 365 Archive file-level policy activities](audit-log-activities#microsoft-365-archive-file-level-policy-activities), and [Microsoft Purview permission activities](audit-log-activities#microsoft-purview-permission-activities).

## July 2026

### Data Governance

- **Updated**: Microsoft Purview protection policies [no longer support Azure SQL Database](data-map-data-sources#azure).
- **New**: [Configure a manual business continuity and disaster recovery environment for Microsoft Purview Data Map](data-map-disaster-recovery). The guidance covers creating a secondary account, mirroring scans, validating the environment, and requesting account promotion during a regional outage.

### Data Loss Prevention

- **In preview**: Protect sensitive data in text and prompts by integrating with Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access (GSA). This integration enables organizations to intercept and inspect text and AI interactions at the network layer, enforce restrictive actions based on DLP policies, and detect risky user activity through Insider Risk Management. It helps prevent sensitive data from being shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, apps, APIs, and add-ins, including generative AI platforms, social media, and collaborative platforms. See [Learn about Microsoft Purview Network Data Security](dlp-network-data-security-learn).
- **In preview**: [Exchange Online DLP policies can detect classification failures](dlp-exchange-classification-failure-protection) caused by timeouts, throttling, and other scanning errors. Administrators can enable classification-failure detection and use the **DocumentScanFailures** condition to apply different protection actions for specific failure types.
- **Updated**: Administrators can use Microsoft Fabric governance experiences in the OneLake catalog to [understand DLP activity and adoption](dlp-powerbi-get-started#gain-visibility-into-dlp-activity-and-adoption). These insights help identify evaluated workspaces, locate sensitive information, track policy adoption, and prioritize high-risk assets.

### Data lifecycle management

- **Updated**: Priority cleanup policies now require [three separate approvals](priority-cleanup-exchange#policy-approvers) before content can be permanently deleted: one Priority Cleanup administrator, one retention manager, and one eDiscovery administrator.

### Information Protection

- **Updated**: Added a [checklist](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#pre-flight-checklist) to help administrators understand auditing, regional availability, label scope, encryption settings, sensitive information types, file eligibility, and required roles before creating an auto-labeling policy.
- **Updated**: [Troubleshoot why a specific SharePoint or OneDrive file was or wasn't labeled](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#why-was--or-wasnt--a-specific-file-labeled). The diagnostic guidance covers unsupported formats, checked-out files, indexing delays, existing higher-priority labels, encryption prerequisites, transient failures, and unexpected labeling.
- **Updated**: [Auto-labeling policies can remove or downgrade sensitivity labels](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#removing-or-downgrading-sensitivity-labels-with-an-auto-labeling-policy). The documentation explains behaviors that are by design and often interpreted as bugs. These behaviors include activation results that differ from simulation, encryption restrictions, cross-tenant label identities, conflicts with label-application policies, and the effect of label removal on encryption.
- **Updated**: [Auto-labeling simulation isn't a completely silent dry run](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#learn-about-simulation-mode). Simulation can generate activity alerts, duplicated policies start in simulation, management actions can remain unavailable during provisioning, and the review experience can mix auto-labeling and DLP results in test mode.
- **Updated**: [Licensing and configuration locations](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#licensing-and-where-to-find-each-surface) are documented for client-side Office auto-labeling, service-side auto-labeling policies, and container-level labels. The guidance also describes common symptoms caused by missing licenses, roles, regional availability, or transient backend failures.
- **Updated**: Auto-labeling policy guidance now identifies [supported and unsupported group types and explains membership-propagation delays](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically?tabs=apply-label#scoping-a-policy-with-users-and-groups). Mail-enabled security groups, distribution groups, and Microsoft 365 groups are supported, while mail-disabled, dynamic distribution, and deeply nested groups have limitations.

### Insider Risk Management

- **In preview**: [Unified alert experience](insider-risk-management-activities#alerts-preview) combines the Triage Agent and Standard alert dashboards into a single alerts list page. View and manage both classic and agent-triaged alerts from one location, with the ability to preview agent summaries, alert and user details directly on the alerts list page.
- **In preview**: [Expanded user profile details](insider-risk-management-users#view-user-details) in the unified alert experience add additional user profile signals from Microsoft Entra, including office location, employee type, department, and last working date.
- **In preview**: [Expanded note capabilities](insider-risk-management-cases#system-generated-notes-preview) across alerts and cases. Analysts and investigators can now add and view notes on both alerts and cases. System-generated notes are automatically applied when there's a change in alert or case status, assigned user, closure, or case escalation.

### Shared capabilities

- **Update**: Microsoft Purview role-group assignments can be configured with an expiration date so that access is revoked automatically. [Temporary assignments](purview-permissions#temporary-permissions) can last from one day to two years and are supported by most built-in and custom role groups, except eDiscovery Administrator and eDiscovery Manager.

## June 2026

### Copilot Cowork

- **General availability (GA)**: [Data security and compliance protections for Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork](ai-copilot-cowork)

### Data Loss Prevention

- **New**: [Access Endpoint DLP device attribute data using Advanced Hunting](dlp-edlp-tshoot-sync#access-device-attribute-data-using-advanced-hunting). Query Endpoint DLP device configuration and policy sync attributes at scale through the DeviceInfo table's DlpInfo column in Advanced hunting in the Microsoft Defender portal, instead of relying on point-in-time exports from the Microsoft Purview portal.
- **New**: [Create a DLP policy that uses device scoping](endpoint-dlp-create-policy-device-scoping). Scope an Endpoint DLP policy to specific device groups — for example, enforce policy only when Finance users access data from Windows devices, and not when the same users work from macOS — using dynamic device groups defined in Microsoft Entra ID.
- **In preview**: New **Email is received from** &gt; **External users** condition for the **Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat** policy location lets DLP policies prevent Copilot from using external email as grounding data, helping reduce prompt injection risk from untrusted senders. See [Block external email from being processed (preview)](dlp-microsoft365-copilot-location-learn-about#block-external-email-from-being-processed-preview).
- **In preview**: [Enhanced matched conditions for Exchange DLP events](data-classification-activity-explorer#enhanced-matched-conditions-for-exchange-dlp-events-preview) surfaces detailed non-sensitive information type (SIT) condition matches in DLP alerts and Activity Explorer for Exchange Online. Each matched condition includes the condition name, matched value, and source.

### Data Security Investigations

- **In preview**: [Endpoint DLP evidence collection](data-security-investigations-search#endpoint-dlp-evidence-collection-preview) is now available as a data source in Data Security Investigations. Investigators can query data captured by endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies on onboarded devices and add the associated content to an investigation scope for AI-powered analysis. This integration enables aggregate analysis of endpoint exfiltration events instead of per-alert triage. For more information, see [Search, review, and refine results in Data Security Investigations](data-security-investigations-search).
- **General availability (GA)**: [Email and portal notifications](data-security-investigations-workflow#email-and-portal-notifications) for Data Security Investigations. Investigators receive notifications through the Microsoft Purview Notification Center and email when setup completes and investigations are ready to use.
- **Updated**: [Data preparation](data-security-investigations-ai) in Data Security Investigations now runs automatically in the background as items are added to scope. You no longer need to manually initiate vectorization before using AI features.

### Device Onboarding

- **New**: [Monitor device health with the device health reports dashboard](device-onboarding-health-reports-dashboard). Use the device health reports dashboard to monitor device onboarding status, policy update readiness, and feature readiness for Endpoint DLP.

### eDiscovery

- **New**: A new *Convert supported file formats to HTML* option is available when [adding search results to a review set](edisc-search-add-to-review-set#create-or-add-results-to-a-review-set) and when [exporting items from a review set](edisc-review-set-export#choose-export-options-for-a-review-set) in eDiscovery. When enabled, cloud-native file formats such as `.loop` and `.page` files are converted to HTML, making the content indexed and keyword searchable in the review set and easier to process in post-export workflows.

### Information Protection client

- **In preview**: [View and label files](information-protection-client-relnotes?tabs=macOS#release-information) with the Information Protection client using macOS.

### Insider Risk Management

- **General availability (GA)**: [Select which generative AI apps to monitor](insider-risk-management-settings-policy-indicators#select-generative-ai-apps-to-monitor) in Insider Risk Management policy indicators. For Microsoft Copilot experiences and Enterprise AI apps, you can now select or deselect generative AI apps for monitoring, reducing alert noise, and avoiding unnecessary pay-as-you-go billing charges.

### Sensitive information types

- **New**: Added definitions for the following sensitive information types:
    - [China physical addresses](sit-defn-china-physical-addresses)
    - [Colombia national ID](sit-defn-colombia-national-id)
    - [Colombia tax identification number](sit-defn-colombia-tax-identification-number)
    - [Greenland physical addresses](sit-defn-greenland-physical-addresses)
    - [Russia physical addresses](sit-defn-russia-physical-addresses)
    - [Russia taxpayer identification number](sit-defn-russia-taxpayer-identification-number)
    - [Singapore physical addresses](sit-defn-singapore-physical-addresses)
    - [South Africa physical addresses](sit-defn-south-africa-physical-addresses)
    - [Ukraine physical addresses](sit-defn-ukraine-physical-addresses)

### Sensitivity labels

- **Preview**: Rolling out, the sensitivity label setting to [prevent connected experiences that analyze content](sensitivity-labels-office-apps#prevent-connected-experiences-that-analyze-content) now prevents all connected experiences in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for Windows, rather than a subset of these experiences.
- **Preview**: Rolling out, the sensitivity label setting to [prevent connected experiences that analyze content](sensitivity-labels-office-apps#prevent-connected-experiences-that-analyze-content) extends to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint across MacOS, iOS, and Android.

## May 2026

### Agent 365

- **General availability (GA)**: [Data security and compliance protections for Microsoft Agent 365](ai-agent-365).

### Data Governance

- **General availability (GA)**: [Standalone data asset data quality scan](unified-catalog-data-quality-scan-asset) is now generally available.
- **General availability (GA)**: [Incremental data quality scan](unified-catalog-data-quality-scan-incremental) is now generally available.
- **General availability (GA)**: Configurable [data quality thresholds](unified-catalog-data-quality-threshold) for data quality rules and data assets are now generally available.

### Data Loss Prevention

- **Updated**: Added the admin permissions ([Directory Reader](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-readers), [Microsoft Edge administration](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#edge), and [Microsoft Intune administration](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#intune-administrator)) required to activate DLP policies for unmanaged cloud apps in Microsoft Edge for Business. For more information, see [Learn about Data Loss Prevention for Cloud Apps in Edge for Business](dlp-browser-dlp-learn).
- **Updated**: Clarified Edge browser profile scope for cloud app DLP policies. Policies for unmanaged cloud apps on managed devices apply across all Edge profiles (work, personal, and InPrivate); policies for managed apps apply only in the Edge work profile. See [Help prevent sharing via Microsoft Edge for Business to unmanaged AI apps from managed devices](dlp-create-policy-block-to-ai-via-edge) and [Help prevent users from sharing sensitive info with cloud apps in Edge for Business](dlp-create-policy-prevent-cloud-sharing-from-edge-biz).
- **Changed**: Removed DeepL and Zapier from the [list of unmanaged AI apps supported by browser policies in Edge for Business](dlp-browser-dlp-learn#unmanaged-cloud-apps).
- **In preview**: New **Block access for specific external domains or users** sub-option for the **Restrict access or encrypt the content in Microsoft 365 locations** action lets DLP policies for SharePoint and OneDrive block access to sensitive files for specific external domains or user SMTPs. See [Actions](dlp-policy-reference#actions) and [Help prevent sharing sensitive items via SharePoint and OneDrive with external users](dlp-create-policy-spo-odb-external#variant-block-specific-external-domains-or-users-public-preview).

### Data Security Investigations

- **New**: [OCR support](data-security-investigations-ai) in Data Security Investigations. Image files are automatically processed with optical character recognition (OCR), and the extracted text is merged and vectorized for AI analysis.
- **New**: [Custom examinations](data-security-investigations-ai-analysis#create-a-custom-examination) in Data Security Investigations. Define your own examination focus with custom prompts to analyze investigation content beyond the built-in examination areas.
- **Updated**: New guidance for [working with large audit search results](data-security-investigations-search#work-with-large-audit-search-results) in Data Security Investigations. When audit searches exceed the approximately 3,000-item limit, use the Audit solution to analyze the full result volume, then split searches into smaller time-based slices for ingestion into an investigation.

### Data Security Posture Management

- **General availability (GA)**: The new version of [Data Security Posture Management](data-security-posture-management-learn-about) is now generally available. Partner solutions for non-Microsoft data sources remain in preview, as does the Data Security Posture Agent. This current version provides guided workflows for proactive risk management and streamlines data security operations so you can more confidently adopt AI across your digital estate.
- **New**: [Support for administrative units](data-security-posture-management-considerations#support-for-administrative-units-in-data-security-posture-management), to bring parity with the classic versions of DSPM and DSPM for AI.
- **New**: To optimize resources, processing is paused for Microsoft 365 data when tenants are inactive for more than 60 days, and automatically resume when you return to the solution. For more information, see [Data updates paused for inactive tenants](data-security-posture-management-considerations#data-updates-paused-for-inactive-tenants).
- **New**: The "Responsible AI FAQ for Data Security Posture Management" is replaced with the more detailed [Application card for Data Security Posture Management](data-security-posture-management-application-card) to better help you understand this solution's AI capabilities, intended uses, limitations, evaluations, safety components, and best practices.
- **New**: Support for Anthropic Claude (Enterprise) when you add and configure the [Anthropic Claude data connector](manage-anthropic-data), now in preview. Claude then displays as another AI application alongside Copilot, Copilot Studio, ChatGPT Enterprise, and other AI apps. Use [activity explorer](ai-microsoft-purview-considerations#activity-explorer-events) to see individual Claude interactions, such as who used Claude, when they used it, and what kinds of content were involved, just as you do for other AI apps. For more information about Purview support for Claude, see [Use Microsoft Purview to manage data security & compliance for Anthropic Claude (Enterprise)](ai-claude-enterprise).

### Information protection scanner

- **In preview**: Administrators can now [enable, disable, and configure](deploy-scanner-feature-control) cluster-level scanner features from PowerShell.
- **In preview**: [Custom Reporting](deploy-scanner-custom-reporting) populates additional columns and tables in the scanner cluster database so administrators can build their own reports directly against scan results in Power BI or any SQL-based reporting tool, without stitching together per-scan CSV reports.

### Reports

- **Preview**: [Custom posture reports](purview-reports#custom-posture-reports) let admins build tailored views of information protection and DLP activity. Assemble metric and chart cards in sections to answer organization-specific questions that complement the built-in posture reports.

### Sensitivity labels

- **In preview**: Rolling out, manual labeling support for MP4 files in SharePoint and OneDrive. For more information, see [Video support (MP4 files](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files#video-support-mp4-files).
- **In preview**: Rolling out, a new [label policy setting for meetings](sensitivity-labels-meetings#policy-settings-meetings), **Apply meeting label to artifacts**, automatically applies the meeting's sensitivity label to recordings and their transcripts (.mp4 files), and to meeting notes (.loop files).
- **In preview**: You can now see the sync status of your sensitivity label publishing policies on the **Label policies** page, giving you visibility into when label policy updates are fully synced across Microsoft 365.
- **Updated**: The documentation section [How to disable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and OneDrive (opt-out)](sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files?tabs=disable-considerations#how-to-disable-sensitivity-labels-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-opt-out) now includes labeling behavior if you disable sensitivity labels for SharePoint and Onedrive after they've been enabled.
- **New**: For auto-labeling policies that are turned on and target SharePoint and OneDrive, per-policy review pages let you monitor daily labeling activity, spot-check labeled and failed files, and investigate labeling failures. For more information, see [Policy-level labeling activity for SharePoint and OneDrive](apply-sensitivity-label-automatically#policy-level-labeling-activity-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive).

## April 2026

### Collection Policies

- **Preview**: Collection policies support [sensitivity labels as a condition](collection-policies-policy-reference#conditions) for scoping detection to items with specific sensitivity labels applied. This condition is supported with browser and network cloud apps detection.

### Data Lifecycle Management

- **New**: Newly created Teams call data records (often abbreviated to CDRs, and sometimes also called *call detail records* or just *call records*) are no longer included with Teams chat retention policies. Instead, they are included in the new support for [Teams call logs retention policies](create-retention-policies#retention-policy-for-teams-call-logs) that you create by using PowerShell. These newly supported retention policies let you manage the deletion of calling-related data when this is required for compliance and regulatory requirements. Call data records previously included in Teams chat retention policies continue to be managed by those same policies.

### Data Governance

- **In preview**: Use a one-time [glossary migration and asset enablement process](unified-catalog-glossary-terms-migrate) to curate data assets and columns with glossary terms. This process allows you to centralize the management of glossary terms by migrating glossary terms created in the classic governance experience into Unified Catalog. When you complete the process, you can [curate data assets and columns](unified-catalog-glossary-terms-create-manage#link-terms-to-data-products-assets-and-critical-data-elements-preview).
- **In preview**: New bulk import, editing, and moving capabilities can help you quickly scale operations in Unified Catalog:

    - [Create data products in bulk](unified-catalog-data-products-create-manage#bulk-import-data-products-preview)
    - [Create critical data elements in bulk](unified-catalog-critical-data-elements#bulk-import-critical-data-elements-preview)
    - [Create glossary terms in bulk](unified-catalog-glossary-terms-create-manage#bulk-import-glossary-terms-preview) and [bulk edit glossary terms](unified-catalog-glossary-terms-create-manage#bulk-edit-glossary-terms-preview)
    - [Move multiple glossary terms between governance domains](unified-catalog-glossary-terms-create-manage#move-terms-between-governance-domains-preview)
- **General availability (GA)**: Now rolling out, the [advanced resource sets](data-map-resource-sets#advanced-resource-sets) capability is available to all customers. Pricing for advanced resource sets is consistent with existing rates for [classic Microsoft Purview data governance](data-gov-classic-pricing).
- **In preview**: Data quality provides [on-premises support for Oracle and SQL server](unified-catalog-data-quality-on-premises-data-sources). On-premises databases are scanned in on-premises infrastructure to ensure that data doesn't move beyond organizations' premises.
