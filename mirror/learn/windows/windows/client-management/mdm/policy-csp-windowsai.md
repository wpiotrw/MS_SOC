## AllowRecallEnablement

| Scope | Editions | Applicable OS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ Device  ❌ User | ✅ Pro  ✅ Enterprise  ✅ Education  ✅ IoT Enterprise / IoT Enterprise LTSC | ✅ Windows 11, version 24H2 with [KB5055627](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5055627) [10.0.26100.3915] and later |

```Device
./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/WindowsAI/AllowRecallEnablement
```

This policy setting allows you to determine whether the Recall optional component is available for end users to enable on their device. By default, Recall is disabled for managed commercial devices. Recall isn't available on managed devices by default, and individual users can't enable Recall on their own.

- If this policy isn't configured, end users will have the Recall component in a disabled state.
- If this policy is disabled, the Recall component will be in disabled state and the bits for Recall will be removed from the device. If snapshots were previously saved on the device, they'll be deleted when this policy is disabled. Removing Recall requires a device restart.
- If the policy is enabled, end users will have Recall available on their device. Depending on the state of the DisableAIDataAnalysis policy (Turn off saving snapshots for use with Recall), end users will be able to choose if they want to save snapshots of their screen and use Recall to find things they've seen on their device.

**Description framework properties**:

| Property name | Property value |
| --- | --- |
| Format | `int` |
| Access Type | Add, Delete, Get, Replace |
| Default Value | 1 |

**Allowed values**:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Recall isn't available. |
| 1 (Default) | Recall is available. |

**Group policy mapping**:

## AllowRecallExport

| Scope | Editions | Applicable OS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ Device  ❌ User | ❌ Pro  ✅ Enterprise  ✅ Education  ✅ IoT Enterprise / IoT Enterprise LTSC | ✅ Windows Insider Preview |

```Device
./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/WindowsAI/AllowRecallExport
```

This policy allows you to determine whether users can export their own Recall and snapshot information. Exporting allows users to share their Recall and snapshot information with trusted apps or websites. Users can export from Settings &gt; Privacy & security &gt; Recall & snapshots &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Export snapshots &gt; Export past snapshots &gt; Export.

Users can also choose to continuously export their snapshots if they turn on the option to Export snapshots from now on from Settings &gt; Privacy & security &gt; Recall & snapshots &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Export snapshots &gt; Export.

Before starting an export, the user must authenticate with Windows Hello and they're notified that their exported snapshots are encrypted since they might contain sensitive information. The user is also notified that they'll need to provide their Recall export code if they want to allow trusted apps or websites access to exported snapshots. The Recall export code is displayed to users during Recall setup even if this policy is set to disabled or not configured. For managed devices:

When you set this policy to enabled, users will be able to export Recall and snapshot information.

If the policy is set to disabled or not configured, users won't be able to export their Recall and snapshot information.

Important

This setting applies to devices in the European Economic Area (EEA) only. Export of Recall and snapshot information is a user-initiated process and is per user. IT admins or other users can't initiate an export on behalf of another.

The list can include Application User Model IDs (AUMID) or name of the executable file.

Use a semicolon-separated list of apps to define the deny app list for Recall.

For example: `code.exe;Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App;ms-teams.exe`

This policy setting lets you define a list of URIs that won't be included in snapshots for Recall when a supported browser is used. People within your organization can use Recall settings to add more websites to the list. Define the list using a semicolon to separate URIs.

For example: `https://www.Contoso.com;https://www.WoodgroveBank.com;https://www.Adatum.com`

Adding `https://www.WoodgroveBank.com` to the list would also filter `https://Account.WoodgroveBank.com` and `https://www.WoodgroveBank.com/Account`.

This policy setting allows you to control the maximum amount of time (in days) that Windows saves snapshots for Recall.

When the policy is enabled, you can configure the maximum storage duration to be 30, 60, 90, or 180 days.

When this policy isn't configured, the maximum storage duration is 90 days unless the current user specifies a different value.

If both maximum storage duration and maximum storage space are set for Recall, then snapshots are deleted when the first maximum is reached.

This policy setting allows you to control the maximum amount of disk space that can be used by Windows to save snapshots for Recall.

You can set the maximum amount of disk space for snapshots to be 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 GB.

When this setting isn't configured, the OS configures the storage allocation for snapshots based on the device storage capacity unless the current user specifies a different value.

25 GB is allocated when the device storage capacity is 256 GB. 75 GB is allocated when the device storage capacity is 512 GB. 150 GB is allocated when the device storage capacity is 1 TB or higher.

If both maximum storage duration and maximum storage space are set for Recall, then snapshots are deleted when the first maximum is reached.

```User
./User/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/WindowsAI/TurnOffWindowsCopilot
```

This policy setting allows you to turn off Windows Copilot.

- If you enable this policy setting, users won't be able to use Copilot. The Copilot icon won't appear on the taskbar either.
- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users will be able to use Copilot when it's available to them.

Note

- The TurnOffWindowsCopilot policy isn't for the [new Copilot experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/evolving-copilot-in-windows-for-your-workforce/4141999) that's in some [Windows Insider builds](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/) and that will be gradually rolling out to Windows 11 and Windows 10 devices.
- This policy also applies to upgrade scenarios to prevent installation of the Copilot app from an image that would have had the Copilot in Windows pane.
