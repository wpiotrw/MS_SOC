# Download attachment content - Microsoft Graph beta | Microsoft Learn

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security.caseManagement

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Download the binary content of an [attachment](resources/security-casemanagement-attachment).

After an upload completes, the service asynchronously scans the attachment for malware. Poll the attachment metadata by using [Get attachment](security-casemanagement-attachment-get). If **scanResult** is `unscanned`, wait and try again later. Download the content only when **scanResult** is `noThreatsFound`. Don't download content when **scanResult** is `malicious`.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 (DOD) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | CaseManagement.Read.All | CaseManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | CaseManagement.Read.All | CaseManagement.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This API supports the following built-in roles:

- Global Reader
- Security Reader
- Security Operator
- Security Administrator

## HTTP request

```http
GET /security/caseManagement/cases/{caseId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/content
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code, a `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`, and the attachment content in the response body.

A request made before content is uploaded or while malware scanning is pending returns `400 Bad Request`. Wait for scanning to complete and retry the request.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows a request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/security/caseManagement/cases/{caseId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/content
```

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```csharp

// Code snippets are only available for the latest version. Current version is 5.x

// To initialize your graphClient, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/create-client?from=snippets&tabs=csharp
await graphClient.Security.CaseManagement.Cases["{case-id}"].Attachments["{attachment-id}"].Content.GetAsync();

```

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](/en-us/graph/sdks/use-beta).

For details about how to [add the SDK](/en-us/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
