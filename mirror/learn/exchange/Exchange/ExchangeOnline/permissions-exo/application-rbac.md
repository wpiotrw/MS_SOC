# Role Based Access Control for Applications in Exchange Online | Microsoft Learn

This article guides you through using granular and scalable, resource-scoped access control: Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for Applications in Exchange Online.

## Overview

RBAC for Applications in Exchange Online allows admins to grant permissions to an application that's independently accessing data in Exchange Online. This grant can be paired with a scope of access (resource scope) to specify which mailboxes an app can access. This feature extends the current [RBAC](permissions-exo) model in Exchange Online and it replaces Application Access Policies. These permission grants are independent of the unscoped grants in Microsoft Entra ID.

The core of this system is the management role assignment configuration, which expresses an admin's intent to allow a principal to access data. In this case, allowing an app to perform some role against a set of target resources. For example, an admin might configure a room booking system with access to calendar data only in specific regions using a [Management Scope](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-managementscope). The following diagram illustrates the role assignment model:

![Diagram of role assignment model with example.](../exchangeonline/media/role-assignment-scope-and-example.png)

## Configuration Instructions

The following steps guide you to create these Application RBAC assignments:

1. Create a new resource scope (optional)
2. Create a pointer to a Microsoft Entra service principal
3. Select the appropriate application role
4. Create a New Role assignment
5. Test the New Service principal

### Requirements

The **Organization Management** role group has the delegating role assignment for the new Application RBAC roles. You need to be a member of the Organization Management role group to assign these permissions. Alternatively, you can use Exchange Online RBAC to grant delegating assignments to these application roles as you see fit. In Microsoft Entra ID, you need the Exchange Administrator role to assign these permissions.

### Define Resource Scope

- **Management Scopes:** An [Exchange entity](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-managementscope) that represents a set of mailboxes using a filter expression on the properties of those mailboxes.
- **Admin Units:** A Microsoft Entra resource that can be a container for other Microsoft Entra resources that contains only users groups, or devices. To know more, see [Administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units) and [Create or delete administrative units](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage).

### Management Scopes

Management scopes allow an admin to scope a set of mailboxes based on the properties of these objects. Refer to the Management Scope documentation for [add](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-managementscope), [remove](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/remove-managementscope), [set](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-managementscope). Here's a list of the [filterable properties](/en-us/powershell/exchange/recipientfilter-properties) in a Management Scope.

Note

While there's a property called Administrative Units, we recommend you use the native Admin Units parameter on a role assignment to avoid creating a scope as an intermediary pointer object.

### Service Principals

Service Principals represent an instance of an application within your organization. You should consider the Service Principal in Exchange to be a pointer to an existing Service Principal in Microsoft Entra ID. Service Principals can't be created directly using Exchange Online tools. Microsoft Entra tools are used to manage Service Principal registrations within organizations. Exchange prevents the creation of an invalid pointer and reflects any deletions of Service Principals in Microsoft Entra ID automatically.

#### New Service Principal

```powershell
New-ServicePrincipal -AppId <Client Application ID in AAD> -ObjectId <Service principal object ID in AAD> -DisplayName <name>
```

The following screenshot helps you find these IDs in Microsoft Entra ID:

[![Screen capture of Microsoft Entra Enterprise applications page.](../exchangeonline/media/enterprise-applications-page-id-capture.png)](../exchangeonline/media/enterprise-applications-page-id-capture.png#lightbox)

Note

Don't use the IDs from the App Registrations page, as it shows different values. The red outlined "Application ID" is the AppID and the "Object ID" is the ServiceID.

You can use another approach to find these IDs using [Get-MgServicePrincipal](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.applications/get-mgserviceprincipal).

#### Remove Service Principal

```powershell
Remove-ServicePrincipal -Identity <ObjectID, AppID, or DisplayName>
```

#### Set Service Principal

```powershell
Set-ServicePrincipal -Identity <ObjectID, AppID, or DisplayName > -DisplayName <Updated name>
```

### Application Roles

Application roles are a special type of management role in Exchange Online, which is only assignable to an Application. These roles can be enumerated using [Get-ManagementRole](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/get-managementrole).

### Role Assignments

Management role assignments tie together a principal, role, and custom resource scope of access. This assignment acts as the permissions assignment for a service principal performing a role across a scope.

#### New Role Assignment

```powershell
New-ManagementRoleAssignment [[-Name] <String>] -Role <RoleIdParameter> -App <ObjectID, AppID, or DisplayName> -CustomResourceScope <Management Scope> (or -RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope)
```

#### Set Role Assignment

```powershell
Set-ManagementRoleAssignment [-Identity] <RoleAssignmentIdParameter> -CustomResourceScope <Management Scope> (or -RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope)
```

### Remove Role Assignment

For removing a role assignment, see [remove management assignment](/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/remove-managementroleassignment).

### Testing Authorization

A test cmdlet can be used to simulate the behavior enabled by RBAC assignments for a particular service principal.

Note

This method excludes permissions that might be granted separately in Microsoft Entra ID.

When testing authorization, you can include an optional resource parameter to evaluate which scoped permissions apply to that target mailbox. `InScope will = true or false` to represent if, true that permission applies to that mailbox for that service principal, or false that service principal has that permission but not over that particular mailbox. Omitting this flag results in "Not Run."

Test results always include the allowed resource scope for a particular assigned permission.

#### Test Service Principal Access

```powershell
Test-ServicePrincipalAuthorization -Identity <ObjectID, AppID, or DisplayName> [-Resource] <target mailbox>
```

## Examples

After using [Connect-ExchangeOnline](/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) in PowerShell, follow these steps:

### Example One: Configuring calendar read access for Canadian users using a management scope

```powershell
New-ServicePrincipal -AppId 71487acd-ec93-476d-bd0e-6c8b31831053 -ObjectId 6233fba6-0198-4277-892f-9275bf728bcc -DisplayName "example"

DisplayName   ObjectId                              AppId

```

```powershell
New-ManagementScope -Name "Canadian users" -RecipientRestrictionFilter "CustomAttribute1 -eq '012332'"

Name                 ScopeRestrictionType      Exclusive      RecipientRoot          RecipientFilter

```

```powershell
New-ManagementRoleAssignment -App 6233fba6-0198-4277-892f-9275bf728bcc -Role "Application Calendars.Read" -CustomResourceScope "Canadian users"

Name                      Role                 RoleAssigneeName       RoleAssigneeType        AssignmentMethod

```

### Example Two: Configuring Mail.Read for all Europe Admin Unit mailboxes

```powershell
New-ServicePrincipal -AppId eb19847b-5563-42ea-b719-ea47cb0cf4b3 -ObjectId 59b7c6cb-58d3-4ee8-a409-8c1f9dbb5d36 -DisplayName "example"

DisplayName    ObjectId                                  AppId
-----------    ---------                                  -----
example        59b7c6cb-58d3-4ee8-a409-8c1f9dbb5d36       eb19847b-5563-42ea-b719-ea47cb0cf4b3
```

```powershell
New-ManagementRoleAssignment -App 59b7c6cb-58d3-4ee8-a409-8c1f9dbb5d36 -Role "Application Mail.Read" -RecipientAdministrativeUnitScope 4d819ce9-9257-44d7-af20-68a49e6697f4

----                         ----                ----------------          ----------------            ----------------
Application Mail.Rea...      Application Ma...   59b7c6cb-58d3-...         ServicePrincipal            Direct
```

### Example Three: Testing permissions assigned to a service principal

```powershell
Test-ServicePrincipalAuthorization -Resource b -Identity "DemoB" |Format-Table

RoleName                      GrantedPermissions          AllowedResourceScope        ScopeType                 InScope
--------                      ------------------          --------------------        ---------                 ------
Application Mail.Read         Mail.Read                   Scope-MESGaDN                CustomRecipientScope     False
Application Calendars.Read    Calendars.Read              Scope-DL1                    CustomRecipientScope     False
Application Contacts.Read     Contacts.Read               Scope-MESGa                  CustomRecipientScope     False
```

## Limitations

- Applications can't become member of a Role Group.
- Application roles can only be assigned to Service Principals.
- Application roles can't be copied or derived.
- Exclusive management scopes don't restrict app access.
- Changes to app permissions are subject to cache maintenance that varies between 30 minutes and 2 hours depending on the app's recent usage. When you test configurations, the test command bypasses this cache. The cache of an app with no inbound calls to APIs is reset after 30 minutes. The cache of an active app is kept alive for up to 2 hours.

### FAQ

#### Why does my application still have access to mailboxes that aren't granted by the scope I used in Exchange Online Application RBAC?

You need to ensure that you removed the organization-wide unscoped permissions assigned in Microsoft Entra ID. The permissions assigned using Application RBAC act in addition to grants you make in Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra permissions can only be constrained using Application Access Policies. In other words, the assigned permissions are a union operation on the permissions from Microsoft Entra ID and the permissions assigned in Exchange Online RBAC. Each authority can act independently.

For example, if your Service Principal has `Mail.Read` granted in Microsoft Entra ID and you configure a resource-scoped `Mail.Read` permission in Application RBAC, it's important that you remove the assignment of `Mail.Read` from Microsoft Entra ID. Otherwise, the union of an unscoped `Mail.Read` grant from Microsoft Entra and a resource-scoped `Mail.Read` grant in Application RBAC results in no effective resource scoping.

#### How can I view and modify all application permissions in one interface?

To ensure admins have a consolidated view of app permissions, we surface these permissions granted in Exchange Online in a Microsoft Entra admin experience. This feature is upcoming, stay tuned.

#### How to migrate from Application Access Policies to RBAC for Applications?

With Application Access Policies, you have a service principal, permissions consent in Azure, and a policy associated with a service principal in Exchange Online. While you can restructure your scoping mechanism using Exchange Management Scopes or Administrative Units, here's some guidance on reusing groups in an App Access Policy as the scope for your RBAC for Applications grant. This process doesn't result in any interruption of use for your app.

**Migration steps:**

1. Create a new management scope, which points to the scoping group from the Application Access Policy.
2. Create the service principal pointer object.
3. Assign the needed permissions to the service principal in Exchange Online with the management scope restriction.
4. Remove consent to permission in Azure.
5. Remove the Application Access Policy.

    When creating the management scope in step 1, you use a recipient filter with the filter parameter `MemberOfGroup`. Here's an example:

    `"MemberOfGroup -eq 'CN=mesga20220818210551,OU=Fabrikam346.onmicrosoft.com,OU=Microsoft Exchange Hosted Organizations,DC=NAMPR00A001,DC=prod,DC=outlook,DC=com'"`

Note

This filter parameter uses the **distinguished name** of the group, which you can find using Get-Group cmdlets.

**Limitations:**

- Nested group members are considered out of scope. Only direct group membership results in the member being considered in scope for the authorization.
- Microsoft 365 Groups, Mail-Enabled Security Groups, and Distribution Lists are supported.

#### How does RBAC for Applications work alongside Application Access Policies?

**Compatibility with App Access Policy**:

RBAC for Applications replaces Application Access Policies.

**The Authorization interoperability can be described as follows:**

- Application Access Policies constrain ONLY the permissions assigned in Microsoft Entra ID.
- RBAC for Applications offers an alternate expression of authorization with an associated resource scope.
- An app can have both Microsoft Entra consented permissions and RBAC assignments. We expect this case when an app has (for example) organization-wide `Mail.Read` and scoped `Mail.Send`.
- Permission consents are additive.

**Example One: consents from 2 systems**:

- An app has `Mail.Read` in Microsoft Entra ID.
- This app is scoped to mail-enabled security group 1 using an Application Access Policy.
- The same app has `Calendar.Read` consented for Management Scope 1 in RBAC for Applications.
- Mailbox A is in mail-enabled security group 1.
- Mailbox B is in scope for Management Scope 1.

MS Graph access to an endpoint requiring both `Mail.Read` and `Calendar.Read` for App 1:

- Targeting Mailbox A: fails.
- Targeting Mailbox B: fails.

This endpoint needs both `Mail.Read` and `Calendar.Read`. While the app has these permissions individually against two separate mailboxes, it doesn't have both permissions against one mailbox.

**Example Two: assigning the same permission twice**:

- An app has `Mail.Read` in Microsoft Entra ID.
- This app is scoped to mail-enabled security group 1 using an Application Access policy.
- The same app has `Mail.Read` consented for Management Scope 1 using RBAC for Applications.
- Mailbox A is in mail-enabled security group 1.
- Management Scope 1 allows access to every mailbox except Mailbox A (according to some filter like `Alias -ne mbxa`).

MS Graph access to an endpoint requiring `Mail.Read` for App 1:

- Targeting Mailbox A: allow.
- Targeting Mailbox B: allow.

While the `Mail.Read` from Microsoft Entra-only allows access to Mailbox A, the RBAC assignment allows access to everything except A. In effect, this assignment allows access to everything because "A and Not A" means everything.

While we outlined these edge cases for completeness, we don't expect Application Access Policies to be typically used with RBAC for Applications. Organization-wide permissions should be assigned in Microsoft Entra ID while resource-scoped permissions should be granted using RBAC for Applications.

#### How many applications are supported by RBAC for Applications?

You can have up to 10,000 applications per organization using RBAC for Applications. Let us know if this limit poses a problem for you. We built RBAC for Applications in a highly scalable way to accommodate the needs of our largest customers.

#### Why is Autodiscover not working?

Currently, the [AutoDiscover service](/en-us/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/autodiscover-web-service-reference-for-exchange) can't be accessed when using RBAC Application roles.

#### If I delete a service principal in Microsoft Entra what happens in Exchange?

Deleted service principals in Microsoft Entra are also removed in Exchange automatically. This removal deletes any assignments made to these service principals but leave management scopes unaffected.
