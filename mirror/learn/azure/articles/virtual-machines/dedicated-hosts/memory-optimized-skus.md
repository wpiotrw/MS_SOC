# Memory Optimized Azure Dedicated Host SKUs - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn

Azure Dedicated Host SKUs are the combination of a VM family and a certain hardware specification. You can only deploy VMs of the VM series that the Dedicated Host SKU specifies. For example, on the Dsv3-Type3, you can only provision [Dsv3-series](../sizes/general-purpose/dsv3-series) VMs.

This document goes through the hardware specifications and VM packings for all memory optimized Dedicated Host SKUs.

Note

The host reserves a portion of the "Available vCPUs" and "Available RAM" listed in the tables below for its own operations. To determine the actual usable resources, refer to the host [pricing page](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing). "Available vCPUs" doesn't account for VM overhead, which varies by VM size. This overhead consumes part of the vCPU allocation, meaning not all advertised vCPUs are available for use.

## Limitations

The sizes and hardware types available for dedicated hosts vary by region. Refer to the host [pricing page](https://aka.ms/ADHPricing) to learn more.
