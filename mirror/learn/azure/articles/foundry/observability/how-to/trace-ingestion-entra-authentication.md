# Configure Microsoft Entra authentication for Foundry Agent trace ingestion (preview) - Microsoft Foundry | Microsoft Learn

Important

Items marked preview in this article are currently in preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and Microsoft doesn't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Use Microsoft Entra authentication for trace ingestion when your agents send telemetry to the Application Insights resource connected to your Foundry project. This approach replaces key-based ingestion with identity-based access control.

This article applies to Foundry agents that send traces to the Application Insights resource connected to your Foundry project.

## Prerequisites

- A [Foundry project](../../how-to/create-projects).
- An [Azure Monitor Application Insights resource](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to store traces (create a new one or connect an existing one).
- Access to the Application Insights resource connected to your project.
- Permission to assign Azure roles on the connected Application Insights resource, such as **User Access Administrator** at minimum. See [prerequisites for assigning roles via the Azure portal](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal#prerequisites).
- [Local authentication disabled](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-ad-authentication?tabs=python#disable-local-authentication) on the connected Application Insights resource to enforce Microsoft Entra ID-only ingestion.
- To view traces in Foundry, the [Log Analytics Reader role](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access?tabs=portal#log-analytics-reader) on the connected Application Insights resource. If the underlying Log Analytics tables are [protected](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/protected-tables-configure), also assign [Privileged Monitoring Data Reader](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access?tabs=portal#privileged-monitoring-data-reader).

## Connect Application Insights to your Foundry project

Foundry stores traces in [Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) by using [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/).

### Update an existing connection

If your project already has a connection to Application Insights and you want to convert it to use Microsoft Entra authentication, follow these steps. If you don't have an existing connection, skip to Create a new connection.

1. Select **Manage** in the upper-right navigation, and then select **Project details**.
2. Select the existing Application Insights connection, and then select **Edit authentication**. [![Screenshot of an Application Insights connection with the Edit authentication option highlighted.](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details-connection-update-authentication.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details-connection-update-authentication.png#lightbox)
3. Select **Project managed identity**, and then select **Save**. [![Screenshot of the Edit authentication pane with Project managed identity selected and the Save button highlighted.](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details-connection-update-authentication-identity.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details-connection-update-authentication-identity.png#lightbox)

### Create a new connection

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). Make sure the **New Foundry** toggle is on. These steps refer to **Foundry (new)**.

    ![](../../media/version-banner/new-foundry.png)
2. Open your Foundry project.
3. In the left navigation, select **Agents**.
4. At the top, select **Traces**.
5. On the right, select **Connect** to create or connect an Application Insights resource.

    [![Screenshot of the Agents tab showing traces and the connect button.](../../media/observability/tracing/traces-connect.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/traces-connect.png#lightbox)

- To connect an existing resource, select the resource, and then select **Connect**.
- To create a new resource, select **Create new**, and then complete the wizard.

1. In the connection creation experience, set **Auth type** to **Project Managed Identity**.

[![Screenshot of Monitor settings showing Auth type options with Project Managed Identity available.](../../media/observability/tracing/trace-authentication-type-project-managed-identity.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/trace-authentication-type-project-managed-identity.png#lightbox)

1. Complete the wizard and select **Create**.

A confirmation message appears when the connection succeeds.

### Use the project details connection path

If you don't see the message bar or **Connect** button, use this alternative way to enable Azure Monitor Application Insights.

1. Select **Manage** in the upper-right navigation, and then select **Project details**. [![Screenshot of the Manage section with the Project details option highlighted.](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/project-details.png#lightbox)
2. Select the **Connected resources** tab, and then select **Add connection**. [![Screenshot of Project details with the Connected resources tab selected and the Add connection button highlighted.](../../media/observability/tracing/connected-resources-add-connection.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/connected-resources-add-connection.png#lightbox)
3. In **Choose a connection**, select **Application Insights**. [![Screenshot of Choose a connection with Application Insights highlighted.](../../media/observability/tracing/choose-connection.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/choose-connection.png#lightbox)

1. Before you select **Connect**, in the connection creation experience, set **Auth type** to **Project Managed Identity**.

    [![Screenshot of Create a new connection showing Auth Type set to Project Managed Identity.](../../media/observability/tracing/trace-authentication-type-project-managed-identity-project-details.png)](../../media/observability/tracing/trace-authentication-type-project-managed-identity-project-details.png#lightbox)

After you connect the resource, your project is ready for Entra-authenticated trace ingestion. Foundry uses project Managed Identity to ingest traces to connected Application Insights.

Note

When you create the connection from the Foundry portal with **Auth type** set to **Project managed identity**, the Foundry portal assigns the **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role to the Foundry project managed identity.

## Set up Entra authentication for hosted agent traces

For hosted agents, in addition to setting up the connection by using **Project Managed Identity**, you also need to grant the **Agent Identity** permission on the connected Application Insights resource.

This permission is required because hosted agent traces can come from two identities:

- **Foundry Agent Service** emits server-side traces by using project managed identity.
- **Agent** emits traces from code that runs in the hosted agent sandbox by using **Agent Identity**.

To assign the **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role to the agent identity, use the Foundry portal or Azure CLI.

# [Foundry portal](#tab/portal)
1. In the Azure portal, open the Application Insights resource connected to your Foundry project.
2. Select **Access control (IAM)**.
3. Select **Add** &gt; **Add role assignment**.
4. Select **Monitoring Metrics Publisher**, and then select **Next**.
5. In **Members**, select the Agent Identity of hosted agent.
6. Select **Review + assign**.

For detailed portal guidance, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
Use this option to create the same role assignment by using Azure CLI.

1. Sign in by using Azure CLI:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```
2. Run the following command to assign **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** role:

    ```bash
    az role assignment create \
      --assignee-object-id "$AGENT_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID" \
      --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \
      --role "Monitoring Metrics Publisher" \
      --scope "$APP_INSIGHTS_RESOURCE_ID"
    ```

    Set these environment variables before running the command:

    - `APP_INSIGHTS_RESOURCE_ID`: Full resource ID of the connected Application Insights resource.
    - `AGENT_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`: Microsoft Entra object ID of the Agent Identity.

Reference: [`az login`](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login), [`az role assignment create`](/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create)

## Troubleshoot common ingestion problems

| Issue | Likely cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Error creating connection: Multiple connection with same category (AppInsights) created, we only allow to have 1 connection for category` | A trace connection to Application Insights is already configured for the project | Update the existing connection instead of creating a new one. |
| `azure.monitor.opentelemetry.exporter.export._base: Retryable server side error: Operation returned an invalid status 'Forbidden'. Your application might be configured with a token credential, but your Application Insights resource might be configured incorrectly.` | Application Insights isn't configured for Microsoft Entra ID authentication, or the ingestion identity is missing **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** on the connected Application Insights resource | [Disable local authentication](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-ad-authentication?tabs=python#disable-local-authentication) on the connected Application Insights resource to enforce Microsoft Entra ID-only ingestion, then assign **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** to the identity that sends telemetry (for example, **Project managed identity** or **Agent Identity**). |
| Traces from agent code don't show up | Agent code uses an identity that doesn't have permission to ingest telemetry, or sends data to a different Application Insights resource | Assign **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** to the Agent Identity on the connected Application Insights resource, and verify your runtime points to that same resource. |
| Connection is created, but traces still don't show up | Ingestion role assignment or connection settings aren't fully applied yet | Verify the authentication type is set to **Project managed identity**, confirm role assignments for the required identity, and wait 2-5 minutes before checking the **Traces** page again. |
