# Publish SIEM solutions to Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Learn

[Microsoft’s commercial marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/home) is an online marketplace for applications and services that lets businesses of all sizes offer solutions to customers around the world. As an independent software vendor (ISV) member of the Partner Program, you can create, publish, and manage your Microsoft Sentinel security information and event management (SIEM) solutions in Partner Center. Your solutions are listed together with other Microsoft solutions, connecting you to businesses, organizations, and government agencies around the world. Microsoft Sentinel solutions published in the marketplace are available to customers in Azure Marketplace and Microsoft Sentinel content hub.

## Prerequisites

- **Solution code approved in GitHub**: Ensure that the Microsoft Sentinel team approved your solution and that the code is merged to the main branch of the GitHub repository. After approval, your solution is available in the GitHub repository for Microsoft Sentinel at `https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/\<Your branch\>/Solutions/\<Your Solution Folder\>.`
- **Solution package created**: Your solution package must be created and uploaded to the GitHub repository and should be available at "https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions/&lt;Your Solution Folder&gt;/Package" folder with the correct version. The solution package contains the *createUiDefinition.json* and *mainTemplate.json* files that are required for correctly listing solutions in Azure Marketplace and Microsoft Sentinel content hub.
- **Commercial Marketplace account created**: If your company already has an account, you don't need to create a new account. The same account can be used for publishing any solutions, including Microsoft Sentinel. If your company is a first-time publisher to Microsoft commercial marketplace, you need to complete a one-time registration process. For more information, see [Create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](/en-us/partner-center/account-settings/create-account#create-a-partner-center-account-and-enroll-in-the-commercial-marketplace).

Note

To avoid delays, we recommend that you sign up for a commercial marketplace account as soon as you engage with us. You don't have to wait until your Microsoft Sentinel solution is ready for publishing.

After you sign up for the commercial marketplace account, Partner Center generates a unique Publisher ID and grants you access to the authoring and publishing experience. Using Partner Center, you can create, certify, and publish your solutions for Microsoft customers.

## Offer configuration

This section provides a step-by-step guide through the tabs in Partner Center to create and configure your offer. For each tab, this guide references only the fields that you need to fill out for Microsoft Sentinel solutions. For fields that aren't mentioned in this guide, you can leave the default values as they are. For more information on the offer configuration process and details on all the fields, see [Plan an Azure Application offer](/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/plan-azure-application-offer).

### Create an offer in Partner Center

To create the offer and configure its top-level attributes in Partner Center, follow these steps. After creation, the offer ID and offer type can't be changed. To make corrections to the Offer ID, type, or publisher, delete the offer and recreate it. To delete an offer, go to the **Offer overview** tab and select **Delete offer**. This action isn't reversible.

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/) with your account.
2. Select **Marketplace offers**.

3. Select **New offer** and then select **Azure application.**

Important

Make sure to set the offer to **Azure Application**. Setting the offer to anything else will require you to submit a new pull request with a new offerID before you can publish your offer.”

[![Screenshot of new offer option in Partner Center.](media/publish-sentinel-solutions/partner-center-new-offer.png)](media/publish-sentinel-solutions/partner-center-new-offer.png#lightbox)

1. Enter the following information.

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Offer ID** | The offer ID should be the same as offer ID mentioned in the SolutionMetadata.json file in your solution folder in GitHub at */Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/&lt;Your Branch&gt;/Solutions/&lt;Your Solution&gt;/SolutionMetadata.json*. We recommend using the naming convention for offer ID as *azure-sentinel-solution-&lt;your-solution-name&gt;*. For example, *azure-sentinel-solution-ciscoumbrella*. Use only lowercase, alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores. ID can't end with "-preview" and can't be modified after selecting **Create**.  Offer ID: Max length is 50 characters. |
    | **Offer alias** | This name isn't used in the marketplace listing and is solely for reference within Partner Center. |
    | **Publisher** | Select the publisher ID that you want to use to publish your Microsoft Sentinel solution. The publisher selected can't be modified after creation of the offer. |

    Note

### Technical configuration

This section in the offer configuration is optional. Skip this section and move on to **Plan overview**.

### Plan overview

A plan defines an offer's scope and limits, and the associated pricing when applicable. For example, depending on the offer type, you can select regional markets and choose whether a plan is visible to the public or only to a private audience. For Microsoft Sentinel solutions, only one plan is required. Select **Create new plan** and enter a plan ID and name. The plan ID should be unique in this offer and is visible to customers in the product URL in Azure Marketplace after publishing. Enter the following details:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Plan setup:** | **Plan type**: Should be "Solution template." <br><br>**Azure regions** – Select Azure Global to ensure that customers can deploy your solution in all Azure public regions that have marketplace integration. |
| **Plan listing** | **Plan name**: Use the name you entered for "Name" in the Offer listing tab.

| **Availability:** | **Plan visibility**: Set plan visibility to Public if you want the plan to be available for everyone in the Azure portal and Azure Marketplace <br><br>**Hide plan**: Leave the check box unchecked. If you check this box, your solution doesn't show up in Microsoft Sentinel content hub. |
| **Technical configuration** | **Version**: Enter the version number of the package you're uploading. The version number should be the same as the latest approved package version in GitHub. Package path in GitHub - */Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/&lt;Your branch&gt;/&lt;Your solution&gt;/Package*<br><br>**Package File (zip)**: Upload the matching package zip file with the same version number you entered for version. **Note**: Make sure that you always upload the latest approved version. |

### Co-sell with Microsoft

No changes required in the Co-sell with Microsoft section. Move to the next step.

### Resell through CSPs

You can opt whether you want to expand the reach of your solution by offering it through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) program. Here you can use from three options that define which of the CSP partners can resell your solution. You can choose any partner, specific list of partners, or you can choose to opt out.

## Partner Center preview

Define a preview audience who can review your offer listing before it goes live. A preview audience is allowed access to your offer before it's published live in Marketplace. They can see and validate all plans, including those which will be available only to a private audience after your offer is fully published to Marketplace.

### Preview audience

Previews let you test and validate your solution in a real environment before it's publicly available to all customers. During this phase, your solution is only accessible to the Azure subscription IDs you listed here. Use this time to confirm:

- Your solution appears correctly in the Microsoft Sentinel ecosystem.
- The data connector installs and reaches a connected state.
- All included content, such as workbooks, analytic rules, and hunting queries deploy and function as expected.

Use at least one subscription where Microsoft Sentinel is active so you can run a complete installation test. When you're satisfied with your validation, select **Go live** in Partner Center to publish the offer to Azure Marketplace and the Microsoft Sentinel content hub. To make changes after reviewing your preview, edit and resubmit before selecting **Go live**.

Add at least one Azure Subscription ID. You can enter your own subscription ID or your customer subscription IDs for whom you would like to enable preview access to your solution. After you select **Go Live** for this offer, this list is ignored, and your solution is visible to all customers. For more information, see [Add a preview audience for an Azure Application offer](/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/azure-app-preview).

Note

If the preview audience hasn't been configured with the correct subscription IDs, you may get the following error “Could not create the marketplace item / Gallery item is required, no gallery item is provided." This error is because the marketplace item is only visible to the subscription ids provided in the preview audience section. To resolve this issue, add the correct subscription IDs to the preview audience and try again.

## Review and publish

After you enter all the details, select each tab to review your offer for errors or omissions. When you're ready, select **Review and publish** from any of the tabs. The review page shows the status of your submission for each tab (Complete, Incomplete). The **Publish** button is enabled only if all the required details are filled out, that is, status shows as **Complete** for all tabs. For pages with **Incomplete** status, select the page link to fill out the missing details and select **Review and publish** again.

In this screenshot, only the **Offer setup**, **Properties**, and **Technical Configuration** tabs are fully filled out and the rest have missing details.

[![Screenshot of Review and publish page in Partner Center showing missing details.](media/publish-sentinel-solutions/partner-center-offers-missing-details.png)](media/publish-sentinel-solutions/partner-center-offers-missing-details.png#lightbox)

After you fill out all the details and publish the solution, your solution goes through a series of checks before it goes live in Azure Marketplace and Microsoft Sentinel content hub.

If your published solution includes a CCF data connector and you want to make it available in Azure Government, see [Publish CCF data connector solutions to Azure Government](azure-government-publishing-guidelines).
