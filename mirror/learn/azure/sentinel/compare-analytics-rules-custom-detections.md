# Compare Microsoft Sentinel analytics rules and Microsoft Defender custom detections - Microsoft Security | Microsoft Learn

This article lists and compares the different features supported by Microsoft Sentinel [analytics rules](threat-detection) and Microsoft Defender [custom detections](/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detections-overview?toc=/azure/sentinel/TOC.json&amp;bc=/azure/sentinel/breadcrumb/toc.json). It also provides additional information, such as plans to support any analytics rules capabilities that aren't available in custom detections, if applicable.

Important

**Custom detections** is now the best way to create new rules across Microsoft Sentinel SIEM Microsoft Defender XDR. With custom detections, you can reduce ingestion costs, get unlimited real-time detections, and benefit from seamless integration with Defender XDR data, functions, and remediation actions with automatic entity mapping. For more information, read [this blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftthreatprotectionblog/custom-detections-are-now-the-unified-experience-for-creating-detections-in-micr/4463875).

## Compare analytics rules and custom detections features

| **Feature** | **Capability** | **Analytics rules** | **Custom detections** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Alert enrichment** | Flexible entity mapping over Sentinel data | Supported | Supported |
|  | Reflect custom detections in [MITRE ATT&CK page](/en-us/azure/sentinel/mitre-coverage?tabs=defender-portal) | Supported | Planned |
|  | Link multiple MITRE tactics | Supported | Planned |
|  | Support full list of MITRE techniques and subtechniques | Supported | Planned |
|  | Enrich alerts with custom details | Supported | Supported |
|  | Define alert title and description dynamically - Integrate query results in runtime | Supported | Supported |
|  | Define all alerts properties dynamically - Integrate query results in runtime | Supported | Planned |
| **Rule frequency** | Support flexible and high frequency for Sentinel data | Supported | Supported |
|  | Near-real-time (NRT) rules on Sentinel data | Supported | [Supported](/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detection-rules#queries-you-can-run-continuously) |
|  | NRT streaming technology - Test events as they stream, not sensitive to ingestion delays | Not supported. Analytics NRT rules test events after they're ingested. | Supported |
|  | Determine rule's first run | Supported | Not supported |
| **Rule lookback** | Lookback support | Lookback is flexible:<br>- Up to 48 hours for frequency higher than one hour<br>- Up to 14 days for frequency of one hour and less | [In public preview](/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detection-rules#lookback). Parity with analytics rules on Sentinel data. |
| **Rule data** | Defender XDR data | Not supported | Supported |
|  | Sentinel analytics tier | Supported | Supported |
| **Automated actions** | Native Defender XDR remediation actions | Not supported | Supported |
|  | Sentinel automation rules with incident trigger | Supported | Planned |
|  | Sentinel automation rules with alert trigger | Supported | Planned |
| **Audit and health visibility** | Rules audit logs available in advanced hunting | Supported (in the `SentinelAudit` table) | Exposed in the `CloudAppEvents` table for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps users.This capability will be available for all custom detections users in the future. |
|  | Rules health logs available in advanced hunting | Supported (in the `SentinelHealth` table) | Planned |
| **Control alerts and events grouping** | Customize alert grouping logic | Supported | Not supported. In the SIEM and XDR solutions, the correlation engine takes care of the alerts' grouping logic and can address the need to configure the grouping logic. |
|  | Choose between all events under one alert and one alert per event | Supported | Not supported |
|  | Group events to one alert when custom details, alert dynamic details, and entities are identical | Not supported | Supported |
| **Control incidents and alerts creation** | Exclude incidents from correlation engine - Ensure that incidents from different rules remain separated | Planned | Planned |
|  | Create alerts without incidents | Supported | Not supported |
|  | Alerts suppression - Define alert suppression after the rule runs | Supported | Not supported |
| **Rules management** | Rerun rule on demand on a previous time window | Supported | Planned |
|  | Run rule on demand | Not supported | Supported |
|  | Health and quality workbooks | Supported | Planned |
|  | Integration with Sentinel repositories | Supported | Supported (Preview) |
|  | Manage rules from API | Supported | Supported |
|  | Bicep support | Supported | Supported (Preview) |
| **Content hub** | Create rules from content hub | Supported | Planned |
| **Multi workspace** | Create custom detections on any workspaces onboarded to Defender | Supported | Planned |
|  | Cross workspaces detection using the workspace operator | Supported | Planned |
| **Testing and validations** | Rule simulation from the rule's wizard | Supported | Planned |
