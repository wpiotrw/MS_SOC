[![Remove apps and configuration](media/remove-apps-config/remove-apps-config.png)](media/remove-apps-config/remove-apps-config.png#lightbox)

1. Select **+ Add**, then select the type of item to remove; **Configuration Item** or **App**.
2. A list of applicable items is displayed with its current state on the device. Select an item to remove, and then use **Select**.
3. The list of selected items is displayed for review; add or delete using the check boxes and header controls. When satisfied with the item list, select **Next**.
4. The **Review + Remove** page is displayed for review, when ready to initiate the remove action, select **Remove**.
5. After the action is initiated, you're redirected to the **Monitor and restore** page. The **Remove** action is initiated for devices that are powered and actively connected to an internet-enabled network; the selected items are removed as soon as possible.

Important

Removal of items such as Wi-Fi, VPN, and Certificates could impact device connectivity, if the items are ultimately used for connectivity to the Intune service. **Remove apps and configurations** is intended to be used interactively by Intune admins working with impacted users. If connectivity is lost, users might need to take actions on devices to restore connectivity; connect the device to a guest or alternate Wi-Fi or cellular network.

## Monitoring the device action remove apps and configuration

After you initiate the *Remove apps and configurations* action on a device, the **Status** column of the **Overview** page displays the status of the action. The status is updated as the action progresses.

You can manually restore the removed items using the **Restore** action. If no restore is initiated, Intune automatically reapplies the apps and configurations within 8-24 hours to ensure the device remains aligned with assignment intent.
