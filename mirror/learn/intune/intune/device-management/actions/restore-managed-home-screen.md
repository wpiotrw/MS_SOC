# Device Action: Restore Managed Home Screen - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn

The *restore Managed Home Screen* device action in Intune re-enables the Managed Home Screen on a device that was previously suspended. When the Managed Home Screen is restored, the device will enforce the Managed Home Screen policies again, restricting access to only the apps and settings defined by those policies.

## Prerequisites
