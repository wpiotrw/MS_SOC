# View your OAuth app details with app governance - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps | Microsoft Learn

Use app governance to gain visibility and meaningful insights on your app ecosystem.

For example, view a list of apps in your tenant, together with relevant app metadata and usage data. Select a specific app to open its details pane and view more data and insights.

## Prerequisites

Your sign-in account must have one of the [required app governance roles](app-governance-get-started#roles) to view app governance data.

## View the apps in your tenant

For a summary of apps in your tenant, in Microsoft 365, go to **Cloud app &gt; App governance** and select any of the apps tabs.

By default, the app governance page sorts the grid alphabetically, by **Display name**. To sort the list by another attribute, select the column name. You can also select **Search** to search for an app by name.

On the **Microsoft 365** tab, the apps in your tenant are listed with the following details:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Display name** | The display name of the app as registered on Microsoft Entra ID |
| **Status** | Shows whether the app is enabled or disabled, and if disabled by whom |

## Get detailed information about an app

Select a specific app in the grid to view more details on an app details pane. Some tabs are available only for specific app types.

Company administrators can use the **Disable app** and **Enable app** controls in the details pane to enable or disable an app.

### Review app details on the Summary tab

The **Summary** tab shows more data about the app, such as the date first consented and the App ID. To see the properties of the app as registered in Microsoft Entra ID, select **View in Microsoft Entra ID**.

[![Screenshot of an app details pane with the Summary tab showing.](media/app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps/app-governance-app-summary.png)](media/app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps/app-governance-app-summary.png#lightbox)

### Review risk details on the Risk score tab

The **Risk score** tab shows a 1-100 risk score for the app, where higher values mean greater risk. The risk score helps you quickly prioritize which apps need attention first. The **Risk score** tab also shows the risk summary, including the factors behind the app's risk score.

### Review app connections on the Graph tab

The **Graph** tab shows a visual identity graph that illustrates how the app connects to other entities in your organization, like users, resources, SaaS workloads, and critical assets. Select any node or edge in the graph to open a details pane with deeper context. When applicable, the graph details pane also shows attack paths involving the selected nodes or edges. To explore further, select **View in map** below the graph to open the full Attack Map experience in a new window.

The graph can also surface the AI agent behind an app. For OAuth apps tied to Microsoft Copilot Studio agents, expand the OAuth app node to view the connected agent.

Note

The Graph tab is available only for OAuth apps registered in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Review user access on the Users tab

The **Users** tab shows a list of users who are using the app, whether they're a priority account, and the amount of data downloaded and uploaded.

If an app has been granted admin consent (approved for the entire organization by an administrator), the **Total consented users** are all users in the tenant.

### Review app permissions on the Permissions tab

The **Permissions** tab shows a summary and list of the Graph API and legacy permissions granted to the app, consent type, privilege level, and whether they're in use. This also shows the Microsoft Entra roles granted to the app, including its type (built-in or custom), privilege level, and whether it grants tenant-wide access. Select a role to view its granular permissions, descriptions, and privilege levels.

Note

Only directly assigned Microsoft Entra roles are shown. Roles inherited through group membership and Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) roles aren't included.

[![Screenshot of the Permissions tab.](media/app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps/app-governance-app-permissions.png)](media/app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps/app-governance-app-permissions.png#lightbox)
