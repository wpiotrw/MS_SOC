# Microsoft Entra Private Access Sensor release notes - Global Secure Access | Microsoft Learn

This article lists the released versions of the Microsoft Entra Private Access Sensor and the changes in each version.

## Download the latest version

You can download the current version of the Private Access Sensor from the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Secure Access Administrator](/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator).
2. Browse to **Global Secure Access** &gt; **Connect** &gt; **Connectors and sensors** &gt; **Private access sensors**.
3. Select **Download private access sensor**.

## Version 2.2.79

Released for download on September 29, 2026.

### Over-the-air automatic updates

- Adds automatic downloads and installation of future sensor updates.

Note

Upgrading from version 2.2.42 requires a one-time installation of the full sensor installer from the Microsoft Entra admin center to enable OTA updates.

### Security enhancements

- Extends Kerberos policy enforcement to UDP alongside TCP.
- Hardens network packet validation and removes the local registry break-glass override in favor of cloud policy.

### Access enforcement

- Matches non-wildcard SPNs and requested Kerberos service names (`sname`) by their owning Active Directory account SID, rather than relying only on exact service-name strings. This extends protection to aliases of the same account. Existing name-based matching is retained when account resolution is unavailable.
- Corrects wildcard SPN matching. Wildcard rules remain name-based.

### Diagnostics and telemetry

- Improves Kerberos transport, service-name resolution, and firewall diagnostics.

### Bug fixes

- Includes bug fixes and minor improvements.

### Upgrade considerations

- Allow inbound TCP and UDP on port 1337.
- IPv6 Kerberos traffic is unsupported and blocked; use IPv4.

## Version 2.2.42

Released for download on June 16, 2026.

### Security enhancements

- Hardens file and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) channels against tampering by using channel permissions.
- Adds fail-close enforcement for policy failures.

### Kerberos observability

- Adds ticket hash computation for AS-REP, TGS-REQ, and TGS-REP.
- Adds differentiated ETW event IDs for all sensor events.

### Configurable ETW trace file size cap

- Caps ETL, trace, and log files at a configurable maximum size.
- Persists the configured maximum size across upgrades.
- Helps prevent disk exhaustion.

### Diagnostics and telemetry

- Improves telemetry reporting to the cloud.

### Access enforcement

- Adds privileged user access enforcement. This capability restricts cloud-based user access to privileged local users by UPN or SID and is in preview.

### Bug fixes

- Includes bug fixes and minor improvements.
