# Configure Chatwork for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Chatwork and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Chatwork](https://corp.chatwork.com/) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

Warning

ChatWork will discontinue support for SCIM-based provisioning effective October 1, 2026. As a result, the ChatWork provisioning integration in the Microsoft Entra Enterprise App Gallery will be retired. Existing customers using the integration will no longer be able to provision users to ChatWork after this date. SSO functionality for ChatWork will remain available.

## Capabilities Supported

- Create users in Chatwork.
- Remove users in Chatwork when they don't require access anymore.
- Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Chatwork.
- [Single sign-on](chatwork-tutorial) to Chatwork (required).
- Code Auth Grant flow authentication supported.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

- [A Microsoft Entra tenant](../../identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant).
- One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
- A [Chatwork](https://corp.chatwork.com/) tenant.
- A user account in Chatwork with Admin permission.
- Organizations that have contracted Chatwork Enterprise Plan or KDDI Chatwork.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment

1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning).
2. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Chatwork](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes).

## Step 2: Configure Chatwork to support provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

### 1. Open **User Synchronization** from the Chatwork admin page

Access the Chatwork admin portal as a user with admin rights. If you have administrator privileges, you'll be able to access the **User Synchronization** page.

**User Synchronization** page contains notes and restrictions for using the user provisioning feature. Check all the items.

![Screenshot of User Synchronization page.](media/chatwork-provisioning-tutorial/chatwork-sync.png)

### 2. Configure the SAML login settings.

If you're using Microsoft Entra ID and user provisioning, login to Chatwork using your Microsoft Entra ID.

### 3. Check the checkboxes after accepting the various items.

Check the checkboxes after accepting the cautions and restrictions for using the user provisioning function.

When all the items are checked, select the **Enable user synchronization** button.

![Screenshot of accepting the various items and enable user synchronization button.](media/chatwork-provisioning-tutorial/chatwork-accept.png)

When the user provisioning function is enabled, a message appears at the top of the page indicating that it has been enabled.

![Screenshot of enabled message.](media/chatwork-provisioning-tutorial/chatwork-enable.png)

## Step 3: Add Chatwork from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Chatwork from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Chatwork. If you have previously setup Chatwork for SSO, you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../enterprise-apps/add-application-portal).

## Step 4: Define who is in scope for provisioning

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who is provisioned based on assignment to the application, or based on attributes of the user or group. If you choose to scope who is provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the [steps to assign users and groups to the application](../enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal). If you choose to scope who is provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can [use a scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

- Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
- If you need extra roles, you can [update the application manifest](../../identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps) to add new roles.

## Step 5: Configure automatic user provisioning to Chatwork

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Chatwork based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Chatwork in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps**

    ![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)
3. In the applications list, select **Chatwork**.

    ![The Chatwork link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)
4. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

    ![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)
5. Select **+ New configuration**.

    ![Screenshot of the Provisioning tab with automatic configuration option.](common/application-provisioning.png)
6. In the **Tenant URL** field, input your Chatwork Tenant URL and Secret Token. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Chatwork. If the connection fails, ensure your Chatwork account has the required admin permissions and try again.

    ![Screenshot of Provisioning test connection.](common/provisioning-test-connection.png)
7. Select **Create** to create your configuration.
8. Select **Properties** on the **Overview** page.
9. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

    ![Screenshot of Provisioning properties.](common/provisioning-properties.png)
10. Select **Attribute Mapping** in the left panel and select **users**.
11. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Chatwork in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Chatwork for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes), you need to ensure that the Chatwork API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

    | Attribute | Type | Supported for filtering |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | userName | String | ✓ |
    | active | Boolean |  |
    | title | String |  |
    | externalId | String |  |
    | urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department | String |  |
    | urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization | String |  |
12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the instructions provided in the [Scoping filter article](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
13. Use [on-demand provisioning](../app-provisioning/provision-on-demand) to validate sync with a small number of users before deploying more broadly in your organization.
14. When you're ready to provision, select **Start Provisioning** from the **Overview** page.

## Step 6: Monitor your deployment

Once you configure provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](../monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs) to determine which users are provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states the [application provisioning quarantine status](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status) article.
