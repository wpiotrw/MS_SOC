# Configure Zscaler ZSNet for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn

The objective of this article is to demonstrate the steps to be performed in Zscaler ZSNet and Microsoft Entra ID to configure Microsoft Entra ID to automatically provision and de-provision users and/or groups to Zscaler ZSNet.

Note

This article describes a connector built on top of the Microsoft Entra user provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following:

- A Microsoft Entra user account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- One of the following roles:
    - [Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator)
    - [Cloud Application Administrator](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)
    - [Application Owner](/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).

- A Zscaler ZSNet tenant
- A user account in Zscaler ZSNet with Admin permissions

Note

The Microsoft Entra provisioning integration relies on the Zscaler ZSNet SCIM API, which is available to Zscaler ZSNet developers for accounts with the Enterprise package.

## Step 1: Add Zscaler ZSNet from the gallery

Before configuring Zscaler ZSNet for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add Zscaler ZSNet from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to your list of managed SaaS applications.

**To add Zscaler ZSNet from the Microsoft Entra application gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps** &gt; **New application**.
3. In the search box, type **Zscaler ZSNet**, select **Zscaler ZSNet** from result panel then select **Add** button to add the application.

## Step 2: Assign users to Zscaler ZSNet

Microsoft Entra ID uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user provisioning, only the users and/or groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Microsoft Entra ID are synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling automatic user provisioning, you should decide which users and/or groups in Microsoft Entra ID need access to Zscaler ZSNet. Once decided, you can assign these users and/or groups to Zscaler ZSNet by following the instructions here:

- [Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](../enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal)

### Important tips for assigning users to Zscaler ZSNet

- It's recommended that a single Microsoft Entra user is assigned to Zscaler ZSNet to test the automatic user provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.
- When assigning a user to Zscaler ZSNet, you must select any valid application-specific role (if available) in the assignment dialog. Users with the **Default Access** role are excluded from provisioning.

## Step 3: Configure automatic user provisioning to Zscaler ZSNet

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Zscaler ZSNet based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

Note

Open a [support ticket](https://help.zscaler.com/) to create a domain on Zscaler ZSNet.

Tip

You may also choose to enable SAML-based single sign-on for Zscaler ZSNet, following the instructions provided in the [Zscaler ZSNet single sign-on article](zscaler-tutorial). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic user provisioning, though these two features complement each other.

Note

When users and groups are provisioned or de-provisioned we recommend to periodically restart provisioning to ensure that group memberships are properly updated. Doing a restart will force our service to re-evaluate all the groups and update the memberships. Please be aware that the restart can take time if you're syncing all users and groups in your tenant or have assigned large groups with 50K+ members.

### Configure automatic user provisioning for Zscaler ZSNet in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **Enterprise apps** &gt; **Zscaler ZSNet**.
3. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

4. Select **+ New configuration**.

    ![Screenshot of New configuration.](common/application-provisioning.png)
5. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, enter the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** of your Zscaler ZSNet Beta account as described later in this article.
6. To obtain the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**, navigate to **Administration &gt; Authentication Settings** in the Zscaler ZSNet portal user interface and select **SAML** under **Authentication Type**.

    ![Screenshot of the Authentication Settings page.](media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/secret-token-1.png)
7. Select **Configure SAML** to open **Configuration SAML** options.

    ![Screenshot of the Configure SAML dialog box with the Base URL and Bearer Token text boxes called out.](media/zscaler-provisioning-tutorial/secret-token-2.png)
8. Select **Enable SCIM-Based Provisioning** to retrieve **Base URL** and **Bearer Token**, then save the settings. Copy the **Base URL** to **Tenant URL**, and **Bearer Token** to **Secret Token**.
9. Upon populating the fields shown in Step 5, select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Zscaler ZSNet. If the connection fails, ensure your Zscaler ZSNet account has Admin permissions and try again.

10. Select **Create** to create your configuration.
11. Select **Properties** on the **Overview** page.
12. Select the **Edit** icon to edit the properties. Enable notification emails and provide an email to receive quarantine notifications. Enable **Accidental deletions prevention**. Select **Apply** to save the changes.

    ![Screenshot of Provisioning properties.](common/provisioning-properties.png)
13. Select **Attribute Mapping** in the left panel and select **users**.
14. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Zscaler ZSNet in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Zscaler ZSNet for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

    | Attribute | Type | Supported for filtering | Required by Zscaler ZSNet |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | userName | String | ✓ | ✓ |
    | externalId | String |  | ✓ |
    | active | Boolean |  | ✓ |
    | name.givenName | String |  |  |
    | name.familyName | String |  |  |
    | displayName | String |  | ✓ |
    | urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department | String |  | ✓ |
15. Select **Groups**.
16. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Zscaler ZSNet in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in Zscaler ZSNet for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

    | Attribute | Type | Supported for filtering | Required by Zscaler ZSNet |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | displayName | String | ✓ | ✓ |
    | members | Reference |  |  |
    | externalId | String |  | ✓ |
17. To configure scoping filters, refer to the instructions provided in the [Scoping filter article](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
18. Use [on-demand provisioning](../app-provisioning/provision-on-demand) to validate sync with a small number of users before deploying more broadly in your organization.
19. When you're ready to provision, select **Start Provisioning** from the **Overview** page.

## Step 4: Monitor your deployment

Once you configure provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](../monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs) to determine which users are provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states the [application provisioning quarantine status](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status) article.
