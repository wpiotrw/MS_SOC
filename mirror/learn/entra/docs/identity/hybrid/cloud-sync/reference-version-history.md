## 1.1.2505.0

**Release date:** September 21, 2026

### New features and improvements

- Added download functionality support for Azure China Cloud.
- Simplified Provisioning Agent configuration by eliminating the requirement for Domain Admin credentials when customers provide a gMSA and select custom gMSA permissions. This enhancement supports hybrid cloud synchronization scenarios and aligns with the gMSA PowerShell cmdlets experience.
- Streamlined the AADCloudSyncTools PowerShell module by removing the Repair-AADCloudSyncToolsAccount cmdlet, aligning the module with the updated Provisioning Agent configuration experience.

### Fixes

- Improved cloud environment discovery for Azure Government tenants that use domain suffixes.
- Resolved formatting inconsistencies affecting security groups during initial synchronization.
- Fixed an issue that could result in unresolved cross-domain directory references causing object-level quarantine errors in AD2AADProvisioning jobs.
- Fixed domain controller affinity paging issues when processing nested organizational units and containers.

### Security hardening

- Implemented additional security hardening improvements to further strengthen the reliability and protection of hybrid identity synchronization deployments.

## 1.1.2334.0

April 14, 2026: released for download

May 5, 2026: released for auto upgrade

### New or changed functionality

- [Account discovery](https://aka.ms/accountDiscoveryDocumentation) is now supported for on-premises applications using ECMA connectors.
- The `Add-AADCloudSyncADDomain` PowerShell cmdlet no longer sets additional Active Directory permissions on custom group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs). Administrators are now responsible for ensuring that the custom gMSA has the right permissions, documented in [gMSA PowerShell cmdlets](how-to-gmsa-cmdlets).

### Fixed issues

- Fixed an issue where the Provisioning Agent service could fail to shut down cleanly, affecting restarts and upgrades.

## 1.1.2108.0

December 4, 2025: released for download only

Sept 22, 2025: released for download only

### Fixed issues

- Added a check for the Hybrid Administrator role prerequisite, and activate the role for eligible authenticated users
- Simplified how to choose your provisioning scenario

- Improved how admins can view their domain controller priority list
- Added UserAccountControl as a System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) property
- Added a configurable password length for newly created users. The default password length for newly created users is 256. Admins can set an integer value between 127 and 256 for newly created users by creating a registry entry with REG\_DWORD data type at:

    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Azure AD Connect Agents\Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent\UserPasswordLength`

### Known issues

- If you are an AzureUSGovernment customer and have enabled writing back passwords with Microsoft Entra provisioning agent, the operation may fail. Please upgrade the agent to version 1.1.2108.0 to address this issue.
