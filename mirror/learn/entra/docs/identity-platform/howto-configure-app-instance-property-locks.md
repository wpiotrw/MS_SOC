# How to configure app instance property lock in your applications - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Learn

Application instance lock is a feature in Microsoft Entra ID that allows sensitive properties of an application's service principal to be locked for modification. It applies to both single-tenant and multitenant applications. This feature provides application developers with the ability to lock certain properties if the application doesn't support scenarios that require configuring those properties.

## What are sensitive properties?

The following property usage scenarios are considered as sensitive:

- Credentials where usage type is `Sign`. This is a scenario where your application supports a SAML flow.
- Credentials where usage type is `Verify`. In this scenario, your application supports an OIDC client credentials flow.
- `TokenEncryptionKeyId` which specifies the keyId of a public key from the keyCredentials collection. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID encrypts all the tokens it emits by using the key to which this property points. The application code that receives the encrypted token must use the matching private key to decrypt the token before it can be used for the signed-in user.

Note

Since June 2026, the **Enable property lock** setting is **Enabled** by default for new applications. Review the lock settings to ensure they protect the sensitive properties your application uses.

## Configure an app instance lock

To configure an app instance lock:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](../identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon ![](media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png) in the top menu to switch to the tenant containing the app registration from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
3. Browse to **Entra ID** &gt; **App registrations**.
4. Select the application you want to configure.
5. Select **Authentication**, and then select **Configure** under the *App instance property lock* section.

6. In the **App instance property lock** pane, enter the settings for the lock. The table following the image describes each setting and their parameters.

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Enable property lock** | Specifies if the property locks are enabled. |
    | **All properties** | Locks all sensitive properties without needing to select each property scenario. |
    | **Credentials used for verification** | Locks the ability to add or update credential properties used for verification. |
    | **Credentials used for signing tokens** | Locks the ability to add or update credential properties used for signing tokens. |
    | **Token Encryption KeyId** | Locks the ability to change the `tokenEncryptionKeyId` property. |
7. Select **Save** to save your changes.

## Configure app instance lock using Microsoft Graph

You manage the app instance lock feature through the **servicePrincipalLockConfiguration** property of the [application](/en-us/graph/api/resources/application) object. For more information, see [Lock sensitive properties for service principals](/en-us/graph/tutorial-applications-basics#lock-sensitive-properties-for-service-principals).
